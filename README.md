This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
I'd recommend downloading an IDE like VS Code or Jetbrains. 
Once downloaded 
Get the project from GitHub

Type: git clone https://github.com/irving226/betterMorals.git
This copies all the project files to your computer
Go into the project folder
Type: cd betterMorals
Step 1: Set Up the Project

Install all the needed parts
open the terminal within the IDE (should be one of the options at the top of the screen if on mac)
once terminal is open make sure you're in the 'better-morals' folder
Type: 'npm install' in the terminal 
This might take a minute - it's downloading everything the project needs

Step 2: Start the Project
Run the development mode

Type: npm run dev
The project is now running!
View the website
Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
Go to: http://localhost:3000
You should see the Better Morals project running!

```


```bash
npm run dev

```
